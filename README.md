# Node-library

The project is a library management application created using Express.js. It allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of books.

The main features of this project include:

1. Book Management: Users can view a list of books in the library, including details such as title, author, genre, and a brief description. They can add new books by providing the necessary information, edit existing book entries, and delete books from the collection.

2. User Interface: The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can navigate through the catalog, search for specific books, and access detailed information about each book.

3. Backend Functionality: The project is built using Express.js, a popular web framework for Node.js. It utilizes routes and controllers to handle various HTTP requests, enabling the creation, retrieval, modification, and deletion of book data.

4. Data Persistence: The application likely employs a database or data storage mechanism to store book information. This allows the data to be saved and retrieved across sessions, ensuring the availability of the library's content.

5. Deployment: The project has been deployed on Railway, a hosting platform for web applications. This enables the application to be accessible online, allowing users to interact with the library from any device with an internet connection.

It's worth noting that this project is based on the MDN tutorial, which provides guidance on building a library management application using Express.js. It serves as a learning resource and practical implementation of CRUD operations in a real-world context.

For more detailed information on how the application functions or specific implementation details, you may refer to the MDN tutorial or the project's documentation and source code.
